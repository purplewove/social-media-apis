=================

currently just a bit of code for keyword searches using twython

to use, make sure twython is installed and then type: 
python filter_terms.py [consumer_key] [consumer_secret] [access_token_key] [access_token_secret] [search_term]

and the script will dump the text from all tweets gleaned from the streaming api containing the search term to standard output. 

find consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token_key, access_token_secret here: dev.twitter.com/apps
